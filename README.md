## HTML

**Semantic HTML** using **best practices** from **W3Schools**. Classes have been developed to facilitate componentization and achieve low specificity.

## CSS

CSS has been written using variables to facilitate maintenance, sustainability, and web growth.

The code employs CSS best practices:

- **Normalize**
- **Display Flex & Grid**
- **CSS variables**
- **Mixins & Functions**

- **Low Specificity**

All this under a **scalable** and **readable architecture**.
